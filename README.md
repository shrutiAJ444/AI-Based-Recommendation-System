The Java-based recommendation system utilizes Apache Mahout to suggest products or content based on user preferences. It implements collaborative filtering, analyzing user-item interactions to determine similarities between users. The system first loads data from a CSV file, computes user similarity using the Pearson correlation algorithm, and identifies the nearest users with similar interests. Based on this, it generates personalized recommendations by predicting items a user might like. When executed, the program outputs a list of recommended items along with their predicted preference scores, helping enhance user experience by offering relevant suggestions.
